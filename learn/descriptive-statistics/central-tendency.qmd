## What is this central tendency?

Cease your doing, hush the world around, and drift into the realm of imagination.
You’re with your friends, it’s a sunny Sunday, and you don’t know what to do.
You can’t agree on the activity, **BUT** you almost all agree that it should happen outside to enjoy the sunshine.

Well, that’s exactly what a central tendency is: finding **a value** that best **represents** the group.


## Why do you need a central tendency?

Just because we need a reference!

Imagine again:
You’re analyzing your monthly expenses.
Some days you spend a little, some days a lot and some days, nothing at all.
You want to understand what a “typical” day looks like.
But you can’t just look at random numbers and guess...
You need a reference to make sense of it,
and to anticipate your future expenses.

### THE MEAN, aka The Diplomat

The average, much like a diplomat, tries to find common ground between very different positions, summarizing a whole set of data into a single number meant to represent everyone. But in trying to please everyone, it often ends up truly representing no one. It smooths out the extremes to create an illusion of balance, even when reality is far more complex.

To calculate it, it’s simple: add up all the values and divide by the number of values (*n*).

**Grades by Subject**

Here are the student's grades:

- Math: 14
- History: 12
- Biology: 16
- English: 13
- Physics: 11

**Calculation**

We use the average formula:
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$

In this case, $n = 5$ and the grades are:
$14$ (Math), $12$ (History), $16$ (Biology), $13$ (English), $11$ (Physics)

So:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{14 + 12 + 16 + 13 + 11}{5} = \frac{66}{5} = 13.2
$$

**Result**

The student's average grade across all subjects is **13.2**
:::

**Advantage**: Super easy to calculate.


**Inconvenient**: The average is easily swayed by extremes.

Picture this: you're out at dinner with nine friends. Nine of you order a simple €20 meal.
But the tenth (who clearly thinks he's Jeff Bezos) casually orders a €500 bottle of wine.

When the bill comes, guess who suggests, with a not-so-innocent smile:

“Let’s just split it evenly, it’s easier that way!”

Suddenly, everyone has to pay €70, even if all you had was the daily special and a glass of water.

In this case, the average doesn’t reflect reality.
One extravagant outlier is enough to throw everything off, and just like that, you’re footing the bill for Jeff’s wine.

### THE MEDIAN, aka The Sage

![MEDIAN Sage ](../../img/Sage_mean.png){width=10% fig-align="left"}


Easy: you sort all the values from smallest to largest, and pick the one in the middle.
That way, there are just as many values below it as above it.


**Advantage**: Immune to extreme values.
Charles can get 20s all day long, it won’t affect you anymore. He’s powerless now. Mwahaha!


**Inconvenient**: It doesn’t tell you anything about the rest of the distribution.


*Example*:
A: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1000]

B: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
In both cases, the median is 3… but the distributions are wildly different.


### THE MODE, aka The Popular Kid


This one’s the value that shows up the most in a dataset.
If the dataset were Netflix, the mode would be the most binge-watched series, the one stuck in the Top 10 week after week.
Not necessarily the deepest, or the best… but definitely the most watched.


**Advantage**: It highlights majority trends or preferences. Super useful with categorical data.


**Inconvenient**: There can be more than one mode (if multiple values tie), and it doesn’t tell you anything about the overall shape of the data.
