# Central tendency




## Let's go OohCrew!


- What the fuck is this central tendency?


- Central tendency? I thought this site was for **all levels**!!!!


- Yeah, donâ€™t worry! Just close your eyes and imagine:
  Youâ€™re with your friends, itâ€™s a sunny Sunday, and you donâ€™t know what to do.
  You canâ€™t agree on the activity, **BUT** you almost all agree that it should happen outside to enjoy the sunshine.


Well, thatâ€™s exactly what a central tendency is: finding **a value** that best **represents** the group.


## Why do you need a central tendency?


- Yes, why? It sounds booooooorrrrinnnngggggg!!!!!!
  Plus, youâ€™re talking about value, and I donâ€™t like numbers... ðŸ¤®


- Just because we need a reference!
Imagine again:
Youâ€™ve just moved house. You need to figure out where to shop for groceries.
There are two supermarkets the same distance from your place.
You want to know which one is cheaper.
Youâ€™re not going to compare every single item one by oneâ€¦
You need a reference.


- OK, if you say so!
  And... how do you go about it?


## The game's 3 bosses


### THE MEAN, aka The Diplomat (26W - 2L - 4D)


To calculate it, itâ€™s simple: add up all the values and divide by the number of values.


Remember back when you used to get your report card in the mail? Like, actual paper in a real envelope?
Yeah, when you were in middle school.


To figure out your average, you'd add the grades from your 10 subjects and divide by 10. Boom, thatâ€™s your mean.


**Advantage**: Super easy to calculate.


**Inconvenient**: Falls into the trap of extremes. (Donâ€™t worry, weâ€™re not talking politics here.)
Let me give you an example: if good olâ€™ Charles, who happens to be the top student, has a 20 average, heâ€™ll pull the whole class average up... and suddenly youâ€™re out here looking like a total failure.
You might end up below the class average, even if you're doing fine, especially if Charles has an identical twin in the class.
(Donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ll show you what that looks like later.)


### THE MEDIAN, aka The Sage (16W - 0L - 3D)


Easy: you sort all the values from smallest to largest, and pick the one in the middle.
That way, there are just as many values below it as above it.


**Advantage**: Immune to extreme values.
Charles can get 20s all day long, it wonâ€™t affect you anymore. Heâ€™s powerless now. Mwahaha!


**Inconvenient**: It doesnâ€™t tell you anything about the rest of the distribution.


*Example*:
A: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1000]
B: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
In both cases, the median is 3â€¦ but the distributions are wildly different.


### THE MODE, aka The Popular Kid (26W - 8L - 0D)


This oneâ€™s the value that shows up the most in a dataset.
If the dataset were Netflix, the mode would be the most binge-watched series, the one stuck in the Top 10 week after week.
Not necessarily the deepest, or the bestâ€¦ but definitely the most watched.


**Advantage**: It highlights majority trends or preferences. Super useful with categorical data.


**Inconvenient**: There can be more than one mode (if multiple values tie), and it doesnâ€™t tell you anything about the overall shape of the data.
