## What is this central tendency?

Cease your doing, hush the world around, and drift into the realm of imagination.
You’re with your friends, it’s a sunny Sunday, and you don’t know what to do.
You can’t agree on the activity, **BUT** you almost all agree that it should happen outside to enjoy the sunshine.

Well, that’s exactly what a central tendency is: finding **a value** that best **represents** the group.


## Why do you need a central tendency?

Just because we need a reference!

Imagine again:
You’re analyzing your monthly expenses.
Some days you spend a little, some days a lot — and some days, nothing at all.
You want to understand what a “typical” day looks like.
But you can’t just look at random numbers and guess...
You need a reference, maybe the **mean**, **median**, or **mode** to make sense of it,
and to anticipate your future expenses.

### THE MEAN, aka The Diplomat

To calculate it, it’s simple: add up all the values and divide by the number of values.

## 📚 Grades by Subject

Here are the student's grades:

- **Math**: 14
- **History**: 12
- **Biology**: 16
- **English**: 13
- **Physics**: 11

## 🧮 Calculation

We use the average formula:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$

In this case, $n = 5$ and the grades are:
$14$ (Math), $12$ (History), $16$ (Biology), $13$ (English), $11$ (Physics)

So:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{14 + 12 + 16 + 13 + 11}{5} = \frac{66}{5} = 13.2
$$

## ✅ Result

The student's average grade across all subjects is **13.2**




**Advantage**: Super easy to calculate.


**Inconvenient**: Falls into the trap of extremes. (Don’t worry, we’re not talking politics here.)
Let me give you an example: if good ol’ Charles, who happens to be the top student, has a 20 average, he’ll pull the whole class average up... and suddenly you’re out here looking like a total failure.
You might end up below the class average, even if you're doing fine, especially if Charles has an identical twin in the class.
(Don’t worry, we’ll show you what that looks like later.)


### THE MEDIAN, aka The Sage


Easy: you sort all the values from smallest to largest, and pick the one in the middle.
That way, there are just as many values below it as above it.


**Advantage**: Immune to extreme values.
Charles can get 20s all day long, it won’t affect you anymore. He’s powerless now. Mwahaha!


**Inconvenient**: It doesn’t tell you anything about the rest of the distribution.


*Example*:
A: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1000]

B: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
In both cases, the median is 3… but the distributions are wildly different.


### THE MODE, aka The Popular Kid


This one’s the value that shows up the most in a dataset.
If the dataset were Netflix, the mode would be the most binge-watched series, the one stuck in the Top 10 week after week.
Not necessarily the deepest, or the best… but definitely the most watched.


**Advantage**: It highlights majority trends or preferences. Super useful with categorical data.


**Inconvenient**: There can be more than one mode (if multiple values tie), and it doesn’t tell you anything about the overall shape of the data.
