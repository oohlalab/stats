## What is this central tendency?

Cease your doing, hush the world around, and drift into the realm of imagination.
You‚Äôre with your friends, it‚Äôs a sunny Sunday, and you don‚Äôt know what to do.
You can‚Äôt agree on the activity, **BUT** you almost all agree that it should happen outside to enjoy the sunshine.

Well, that‚Äôs exactly what a central tendency is: finding **a value** that best **represents** the group.


## Why do you need a central tendency?

Just because we need a reference!

Imagine again:
You‚Äôre analyzing your monthly expenses.
Some days you spend a little, some days a lot and some days, nothing at all.
You want to understand what a ‚Äútypical‚Äù day looks like.
But you can‚Äôt just look at random numbers and guess...
You need a reference to make sense of it,
and to anticipate your future expenses.


## The game's 3 bosses


### THE MEAN, aka The Diplomat

![MEAN Diplomat](../../img/Diplo_mean.png){width=10% fig-align="left"}

The average, much like a diplomat, tries to find common ground between very different positions, summarizing a whole set of data into a single number meant to represent everyone. But in trying to please everyone, it often ends up truly representing no one. It smooths out the extremes to create an illusion of balance, even when reality is far more complex.

To calculate it, it‚Äôs simple: add up all the values and divide by the number of values (*n*).

**Grades by Subject**

Here are the student's grades:

- Math: 14
- History: 12
- Biology: 16
- English: 13
- Physics: 11

**Calculation**

We use the average formula:
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$

In this case, $n = 5$ and the grades are:
$14$ (Math), $12$ (History), $16$ (Biology), $13$ (English), $11$ (Physics)

So:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{14 + 12 + 16 + 13 + 11}{5} = \frac{66}{5} = 13.2
$$

**Result**

The student's average grade across all subjects is **13.2**
:::

**Advantage**: Super easy to calculate.


**Inconvenient**: The average is easily swayed by extremes.

Picture this: you're out at dinner with nine friends. Nine of you order a simple ‚Ç¨20 meal.
But the tenth (who clearly thinks he's Jeff Bezos) casually orders a ‚Ç¨500 bottle of wine.

When the bill comes, guess who suggests, with a not-so-innocent smile:

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just split it evenly, it‚Äôs easier that way!‚Äù

Suddenly, everyone has to pay ‚Ç¨70, even if all you had was the daily special and a glass of water.

In this case, the average doesn‚Äôt reflect reality.
One extravagant outlier is enough to throw everything off, and just like that, you‚Äôre footing the bill for Jeff‚Äôs wine.

### THE MEDIAN, aka The Sage

![MEDIAN Sage ](../../img/Sage_mean.png){width=10% fig-align="left"}

The median, like a true sage, seeks not to negotiate between all voices, but to quietly find the calm center.
It doesn't care about the noisy extremes it simply stands exactly in the middle, indifferent to the chaos around it.
Where the mean tries to please everyone, the median just listens to the crowd, sorts them in order, and picks the one right at the heart.
In a world full of wild fluctuations, the median offers a simple, steady answer:
‚ÄúHere is the center. Deal with it.‚Äù

To calculate, it's easy: you sort all the values from smallest to largest, and pick the one in the middle.
That way, there are just as many values below it as above it.

#### Illustration
<br> **Grades by Subject**
Here are the student's grades:

- Math: 14
- History: 12
- Biology: 16
- English: 13
- Physics: 11

**Calculation**

First, sort the grades in ascending order:

$$
11\quad 12\quad 13\quad 14\quad 16
$$

Since there are 5 values (an odd number), the median is simply the middle value, which is 13.

<br>
If the student also had a grade in Chemistry:

Chemistry: 15

Then the grades would be:

$$
11\quad 12\quad 13\quad 14\quad 15\quad 16
$$

Since there are now 6 values (an even number), the median is calculated by taking the average of the two middle values:

So:
Median calcul

$$
\text{Median} = \frac{13 + 14}{2} = \frac{27}{2} = 13.5
$$

**Result**

With 5 subjects, the student's median grade is 13.

With 6 subjects, the student's median grade is 13.5.

:::




**Advantage**: The median is not affected by extreme values ‚Äî it gives a better idea of the "typical" case.

**Inconvenient**: It ignores how far apart the data points are ‚Äî you lose some information about the distribution.

*Example*:<br>
A: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1000]<br>

B: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br><br>
In both cases, the median is 3‚Ä¶ but the distributions are wildly different.

### THE MODE, aka The Popular Kid
![MEDIAN Sage ](../../img/popular_mode.png){width=10% fig-align="left"}

The mode is the one that shows up the most.
If data were a party, the mode would be the person everyone knows ‚Äî not necessarily the smartest or the richest, but the most recognized.

It captures the most frequent value in a dataset, revealing what‚Äôs most common.

In short:
Mean = balance
Median = center
Mode = popularity contest winner

<br>
To calculate the mode, you simply look for the value that appears most often.

If there‚Äôs a tie (several values occur equally often), your dataset is multimodal.
If every value is unique, technically there‚Äôs no mode.

<br> **Grades by Subject**
Here are the student's grades:

- Math: 14
- History: 12
- Biology: 16
- English: 13
- Physics: 11
- Art: 14

**Calculation**

First, list the grades:


$$
11\quad 12\quad 13\quad 14\quad 14\quad 16
$$

The number 14 appears twice, more than any other grade.

**Result**

The student's most common grade "the mode" is 14.

:::

**Advantage**:

Very simple to understand.

Perfect for categorical data (like favorite color, t-shirt size, etc.).

Highlights the most popular or frequent value.

**Inconvenient**:

Sometimes there‚Äôs no mode (if all values are unique).

Or there can be multiple modes (which can make things messy).

The mode doesn't tell you anything about the data‚Äôs spread or the values between.

Example:<br> You survey people‚Äôs favorite ice cream flavors, and the most common answer is "chocolate."
But it doesn‚Äôt tell you how many love vanilla, strawberry, or mango, it just points to the most frequent choice.




## How to calculate central tendency in Python and R?
So far, you know the theory.
Now, let's dive into the real deal: how to actually calculate the mean, median, and mode with code.

We‚Äôll keep it light and simple ‚Äî just enough for you to copy-paste and run it, whether you‚Äôre a Python or R fan.
