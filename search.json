    "text": "The three bosses in the game of central tendency\n\nTHE MEAN, aka The Diplomat\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean, much like a diplomat, tries to find common ground between very different positions, summarizing a whole set of data into a single number meant to represent everyone. But in trying to please everyone, it often ends up truly representing no one. It smooths out the extremes to create an illusion of balance, even when reality is far more complex.\nTo calculate it, it’s simple: add up all the values and divide by the number of values (n). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration\n\n\n\n Grades by Subject\nHere are the student’s grades:\n\nMath: 14\nHistory: 12\nBiology: 16\nEnglish: 13\nPhysics: 11\n\nCalculation\nWe use the average formula: \n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\n\nIn this case, n = 5 and the grades are: 14 (Math), 12 (History), 16 (Biology), 13 (English), 11 (Physics)\nSo:\n\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{14 + 12 + 16 + 13 + 11}{5} = \\frac{66}{5} = 13.2\n\nResult\nThe student’s average grade across all subjects is 13.2\n\n\nAdvantage: Super easy to calculate.\nInconvenient: The average is easily swayed by extremes.\nPicture this: you’re out at dinner with nine friends. Nine of you order a simple €20 meal. But the tenth (who clearly thinks he’s Jeff Bezos) casually orders a €500 bottle of wine.\nWhen the bill comes, guess who suggests, with a not-so-innocent smile:\n“Let’s just split it evenly, it’s easier that way!”\nSuddenly, everyone has to pay €70, even if all you had was the daily special and a glass of water.\nIn this case, the average doesn’t reflect reality. One extravagant outlier is enough to throw everything off, and just like that, you’re footing the bill for Jeff’s wine.\n \n\n\nTHE MEDIAN, aka The Sage\n\n\n\n\n\nThe median, like a true sage, seeks not to negotiate between all voices, but to quietly find the calm center. It doesn’t care about the noisy extremes it simply stands exactly in the middle, indifferent to the chaos around it. Where the mean tries to please everyone, the median just listens to the crowd, sorts them in order, and picks the one right at the heart. In a world full of wild fluctuations, the median offers a simple, steady answer: “Here is the center. Deal with it.”\nTo calculate, it’s easy: you sort all the values from smallest to largest, and pick the one in the middle. That way, there are just as many values below it as above it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration\n\n\n\n Grades by Subject Here are the student’s grades:\n\nMath: 14\nHistory: 12\nBiology: 16\nEnglish: 13\nPhysics: 11\n\nCalculation\nFirst, sort the grades in ascending order:\n\n11\\quad 12\\quad 13\\quad 14\\quad 16\n\nSince there are 5 values (an odd number), the median is simply the middle value, which is 13.\n If the student also had a grade in Chemistry:\nChemistry: 15\nThen the grades would be:\n\n11\\quad 12\\quad 13\\quad 14\\quad 15\\quad 16\n\nSince there are now 6 values (an even number), the median is calculated by taking the average of the two middle values:\nSo: Median calcul\n\n\\text{Median} = \\frac{13 + 14}{2} = \\frac{27}{2} = 13.5\n\nResult\nWith 5 subjects, the student’s median grade is 13.\nWith 6 subjects, the student’s median grade is 13.5.\n\n\nAdvantage: The median is not affected by extreme values, it gives a better idea of the “typical” case.\nInconvenient: It ignores how far apart the data points are, you lose some information about the distribution.\nExample: A: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1000]\nB: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] In both cases, the median is 3… but the sum, the distributions are wildly different.\n\n\n\nTHE MODE, aka The Popular Kid\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mode is the one that shows up the most. If data were a party, the mode would be the person everyone knows, not necessarily the smartest or the richest, but the most recognized.\nIt captures the most frequent value in a dataset, revealing what’s most common.\nIn short: Mean = balance Median = center Mode = popularity contest winner\n To calculate the mode, you simply look for the value that appears most often.\nIf there’s a tie (several values occur equally often), your dataset is multimodal. If every value is unique, technically there’s no mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration\n\n\n\n Grades by Subject Here are the student’s grades:\n\nMath: 14\nHistory: 12\nBiology: 16\nEnglish: 13\nPhysics: 11\nArt: 14\n\nCalculation\nFirst, list the grades:\n\n11\\quad 12\\quad 13\\quad 14\\quad 14\\quad 16\n\nThe number 14 appears twice, more than any other grade.\nResult\nThe student’s most common grade “the mode” is 14.\n\n\nAdvantage:\nVery simple to understand.\nPerfect for categorical data (like favorite color, t-shirt size, etc.).\nHighlights the most popular or frequent value.\nInconvenient:\nSometimes there’s no mode (if all values are unique).\nOr there can be multiple modes (which can make things messy).\nThe mode doesn’t tell you anything about the data’s spread or the values between.\nExample: You survey people’s favorite ice cream flavors, and the most common answer is “chocolate.” But it doesn’t tell you how many love vanilla, strawberry, or mango, it just points to the most frequent choice.",
